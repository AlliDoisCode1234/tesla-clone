## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, Styled Components, React Animate, Material-UI

Using the create-react-app redux template, I created a section component with props to render the majority of the application seamlessly. Used react animate to mirror Tesla's chic user experience. Styled Components to minimize additional css files and provide clean styling. 

## Lessons Learned:

Material-UI is comparable to Styled Components, but maybe a better use case to have a structure. The create react app redux template has many quirks, but is useful when setting up a global state store like redux. Conceptualizing the system's architectural design pattern at initialization is essential.

## Examples:
